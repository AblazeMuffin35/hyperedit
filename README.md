# HyperEdit

HyperEdit is a simple HTML editor that was made with Vite and React. It's not a full editor, but it's good enough for basic documents and websites. HyperEdit can currently export to HTML and plain text with more options coming soon. You can visit HyperEdit at https://hyperedit.vercel.app/. Remember that HyperEdit is still in developement, so minor bugs and issues may be present.
